This project aims to utilize sentiment analysis models to analyze comments about
board games, with the goal of identifying the positive, neutral and negative
aspects of these games. This study aims to explore board game data to uncover
insights regarding user preferences and factors contributing to game popularity.
By leveraging sentiment analysis, particularly through BERT-based models, we
classified user comments into sentiment categories and further analyzed these
sentiments with respect to specific aspects of the games.
